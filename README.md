## UpcomingMovies (Web App)

UpcomingMovies is a full stack web application, which allows users to view/add/edit/delete upcoming movie information in nearby theaters. The demo is deployed on Heroku.

The front-end interface is based on **React** and **Bootstrap**. The back-end services are implemented using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, integrated with **MongoDB Atlas** managing movie and theater entries.
